Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29. Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group.
Rudolph Agnew, 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate.
J.P. Bolduc, vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co., which holds a 83.4 interest in this energy-services company, was elected a director. He succeeds Terrence D. Daniels, formerly a W.R. Grace vice chairman, who resigned. W.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energys seven board seats.
Yields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide, amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates. The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghues Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday. Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year. Average maturity of the funds investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghues. Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period. Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner. The average maturity for funds open only to institutions, considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely, reached a high point for the year -- 33 days. Nevertheless, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields may blip up again before they blip down because of recent rises in short-term interest rates. The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Mondays auction, for example, rose to 8.04% from 7.90%. Despite recent declines in yields, investors continue to pour cash into money funds. Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion during the latest week, to $352.7 billion. Typically, money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates. The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9%. Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar, the top-yielding fund, had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier. It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees, which boosts its yield. The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%. The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19% from 8.22%; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53% from 8.56%.
Pacific First Financial Corp. said shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $27 a share, or $212 million. The thrift holding company said it expects to obtain regulatory approval and complete the transaction by year-end.
McDermott International Inc. said its Babcock & Wilcox unit completed the sale of its Bailey Controls Operations to Finmeccanica S.p. A. for $295 million. Finmeccanica is an Italian state-owned holding company with interests in the mechanical engineering industry. Bailey Controls, based in Wickliffe, Ohio, makes computerized industrial controls systems. It employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $370 million.
The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress hasnt lifted the ceiling on government debt. Until Congress acts, the government hasnt any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind, the Treasury said. The governments borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $2.80 trillion from $2.87 trillion. Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes. The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $3.1 trillion, but the Senate isnt expected to act until next week at the earliest. The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress doesnt act by then.
Clark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp. In the new position he will oversee Mazdas U.S. sales, service, parts and marketing operations. Previously, Mr. Vitulli, 43 years old, was general marketing manager of Chrysler Corp. s Chrysler division. He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years.
When its time for their biannual powwow, the nations manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs. Not this year. The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting. And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners. The idea, of course: to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt isnt so rusty after all, that its a good place for a company to expand. On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag, along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory. For starters, the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge. Champagne and dessert followed. The next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, unimpeded by traffic or red lights. The governor couldnt make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests. A buffet breakfast was held in the museum, where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors. Then, in the guests honor, the speedway hauled out four drivers, crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race. After the race, Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers. No dummies, the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsors name or two. Back downtown, the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again. This time, it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away. Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom, nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline, lobster consomme, veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce. Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one, the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation. More than a few CEOs say the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings. But for now, theyre looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February.
South Korea registered a trade deficit of $101 million in October, reflecting the countrys economic sluggishness, according to government figures released Wednesday. Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October, the fifth monthly setback this year, casting a cloud on South Koreas export-oriented economy. Exports in October stood at $5.29 billion, a mere 0.7% increase from a year earlier, while imports increased sharply to $5.39 billion, up 20% from last October. South Koreas economic boom, which began in 1986, stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes, trade conflicts and sluggish exports. Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $68 billion. Despite the gloomy forecast, South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $71 million so far this year. From January to October, the nations accumulated exports increased 4% from the same period last year to $50.45 billion. Imports were at $50.38 billion, up 19%.
Newsweek, trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine, announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers. The new ad plan from Newsweek, a unit of the Washington Post Co., is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years. Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek, Time Warner Inc. s Time magazine, and Mortimer B. Zuckermans U.S. News & World Report. Alan Spoon, recently named Newsweek president, said Newsweeks ad rates would increase 5% in January. A full, four-color page in Newsweek will cost $100,980. In mid-October, Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates; with a lower circulation base, Times ad rate will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber; a full page in Time costs about $120,000. U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates. Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan, which awards space credits to advertisers on renewal advertising. The magazine will reward with page bonuses advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending, as long as they spent $325,000 in 1989 and $340,000 in 1990. Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; Newsweeks ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to Publishers Information Bureau. What matters is what advertisers are paying per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall, said Mr. Spoon. Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches. However, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently. According to Audit Bureau of Circulations, Time, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%. Newsweeks circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453, flat from the same period last year. U.S. News circulation in the same time was 2,303,328, down 2.6%.
New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer. The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire, which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company. New England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., had offered $2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire, well below the $2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth. United Illuminating is based in New Haven, Conn., and Northeast is based in Hartford, Conn. PS of New Hampshire, Manchester, N.H., values its internal reorganization plan at about $2.2 billion. John Rowe, president and chief executive officer of New England Electric, said the companys return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- didnt come true. When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out. That got hard to take, he added. Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric. No matter who owns PS of New Hampshire, after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation, he said. That attracts attention . . . it was just another one of the risk factors that led to the companys decision to withdraw from the bidding, he added. Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., the financial adviser to the troubled companys equity holders, said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process. The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8% over seven years against around 5.5% boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials, Mr. Ross asserted. Now the field is less cluttered, he added. Separately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire. Northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court. PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $3.75, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Norman Ricken, 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys R Us Inc., and Frederick Deane Jr., 63, chairman of Signet Banking Corp., were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain. They succeed Daniel M. Rexinger, retired Circuit City executive vice president, and Robert R. Glauber, U.S. Treasury undersecretary, on the 12-member board.
Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund about $250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant. The refund was about $55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility. State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of about $45 to $50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986, including about two million customers who have moved during that period. Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he wouldnt entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison. The refund pool . . . may not be held hostage through another round of appeals, Judge Curry said. Commonwealth Edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Currys order. The exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year. Commonwealth Edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $1.55 a share. For 1988, Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $737.5 million, or $3.01 a share. A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past 3 1/2 years would be an administrative nightmare. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Commonwealth Edison closed at $38.375, down 12.5 cents. The $2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford, Ill., was completed in 1985. In a disputed 1985 ruling, the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $49 million to pay for the plant. But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commissions rate increase and found the rates illegal. The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edisons construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses. The utility has been collecting for the plants construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986. In August, the commission ruled that between $190 million and $195 million of the plants construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded, plus interest. In his ruling, Judge Curry added an additional $55 million to the commissions calculations. Last month, Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9%. Commonwealth Edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated at $140 million. And consumer groups hope that Judge Currys Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edisons Braidwood 2 plant. Commonwealth Edison is seeking about $245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2. The commission is expected to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end. Last year Commonwealth Edison had to refund $72.7 million for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant.
Japans domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units, a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. The strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21% in August and 12% in September. The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March. October sales, compared with the previous month, inched down 0.4%. Sales of passenger cars grew 22% from a year earlier to 361,376 units. Sales of medium-sized cars, which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax, more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988.
Texas Instruments Japan Ltd., a unit of Texas Instruments Inc., said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices. The new plant, located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul, will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea, the company said. The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances.
John R. Stevens, 49 years old, was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer, both new positions. He will continue to report to Donald Pardus, president and chief executive officer. Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric-utility holding company. Arthur A. Hatch, 59, was named executive vice president of the company. He was previously president of the companys Eastern Edison Co. unit. John D. Carney, 45, was named to succeed Mr. Hatch as president of Eastern Edison. Previously he was vice president of Eastern Edison. Robert P. Tassinari, 63, was named senior vice president of Eastern Utilities. He was previously vice president.
The U.S., claiming some success in its trade diplomacy, removed South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents, copyrights and other intellectual-property rights. However, five other countries -- China, Thailand, India, Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced. Under the new U.S. trade law, those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they dont improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring. Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made genuine progress on this touchy issue. She said there is growing realization around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations, and particularly the creativity and inventiveness of an {offending} countrys own citizens. U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there. Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates. Seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams, she said. Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement, amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films. That measure could compel Taipeis growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films. Saudi Arabia, for its part, has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works, Mrs. Hills said. These three countries arent completely off the hook, though. They will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries. Those countries -- including Japan, Italy, Canada, Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list. Gary Hoffman, a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases, said the threat of U.S. retaliation, combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a countrys own interest, prompted the improvements made by South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working, he said. He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law. Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia. She didnt elaborate, although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey. The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30. So far, Mrs. Hills hasnt deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act.
Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $64 billion -- the third-highest in the developing world. The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature. The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year. Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50% in the value of its external debt, Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman, Miguel Alurralde. Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford. Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks. Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved. But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven.
(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) THREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977. That year the Apple II, Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market. The computers were crude by todays standards. Apple II owners, for example, had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes. But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I, which was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club. In addition, the Apple II was an affordable $1,298. Crude as they were, these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office. Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years. But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair, Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories. Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts. There were many pioneer PC contributors. William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs, and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981. Alan F. Shugart, currently chairman of Seagate Technology, led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs. Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, two Atlanta engineers, were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone. IBM, the world leader in computers, didnt offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market. Today, PC shipments annually total some $38.3 billion world-wide.
F.H. Faulding & Co., an Australian pharmaceuticals company, said its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $23 million. Kalipharma is a New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the Purepac label. Faulding said it owns 33% of Moleculons voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19%. That stake, together with its convertible preferred stock holdings, gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70% of Moleculons voting stock.
Oil production from Australias Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field, the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990. Esso Australia Ltd., a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp., and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture. Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday. Output will be gradually increased until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day. The field has reserves of 21 million barrels. Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels. The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year, and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year. Esso said the fields were developed after the Australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax.
R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the units president, Thomas R. Sloan, and other managers. Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy-out group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year, the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses. The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program.
The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that arent produced in significant quantities in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions. The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations. Previously, watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment. Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications. The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned down such treatment for other types of watches because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands. Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences. U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the presidents action. Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $37.3 million in 1988, a relatively small share of the $1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year, according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
Magna International Inc. s chief financial officer, James McAlpine, resigned and its chairman, Frank Stronach, is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around, the company said. Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained, Magna said. Stephen Akerfeldt, currently vice president finance, will succeed Mr. McAlpine. An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn. The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years, despite steady sales growth. Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the companys Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars (US$13.73). On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$9.625. Mr. Stronach, founder and controlling shareholder of Magna, resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek, unsuccessfully, a seat in Canadas Parliament. Analysts said Mr. Stronach wants to resume a more influential role in running the company. They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization. The company said Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring, assisted by Manfred Gingl, president and chief executive. Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached for comment. Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career, with Magna as one of his clients.
Lord Chilver, 63-year-old chairman of English China Clays PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British chemical company.
Japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $701 million, the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said. The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments, Fannie Maes chairman, David O. Maxwell, said at a news conference. He said more than 90% of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors. The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong. Earlier this year, Japanese investors snapped up a similar, $570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund. That fund was put together by Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank. The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman, Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japans Daiwa Securities Co. The new, seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors. First, they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline, and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates. Second, they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments, reducing the administrative burden on investors. By addressing those problems, Mr. Maxwell said, the new funds have become extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1% of the $900 billion in such instruments outstanding, and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate. They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Maes corporate debt, buying $2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year, or almost a tenth of the total amount issued.
James L. Pate, 54-year-old executive vice president, was named a director of this oil concern, expanding the board to 14 members.
LTV Corp. said a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed to extend until March 8, 1990, the period in which the steel, aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan. The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, giving it court protection from creditors lawsuits while it attempts to work out a plan to pay its debts.
Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p. A., through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit, began its $37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V., a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands. The offer, advertised in todays editions of The Wall Street Journal, is scheduled to expire at the end of November. Montedison currently owns about 72% of Erbamonts common shares outstanding. The offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies.
Japans reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $1.82 billion in October to $84.29 billion, the Finance Ministry said. The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline. The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June, when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level. The announcement follows a sharper $2.2 billion decline in the countrys foreign reserves in September to $86.12 billion.
The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government, the State Department said. If the debts are repaid, it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. However, after two meetings with the Soviets, a State Department spokesman said that its too early to say whether that will happen. Coincident with the talks, the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch. The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July. But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $188 million debt, which was lent to the countrys short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917. Under a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as amended, its illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government, unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization. Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value. The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act. But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program.
BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars (US$85.1 million) of 10.5% senior debentures due Nov. 30, 1999, together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants. The Toronto-based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase. The warrants expire Nov. 30, 1990. The issue will be swapped into fixed-rate U.S. dollars at a rate the company said is less than 9%; a spokesman declined to elaborate. Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc., both Toronto-based investment dealers. Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month.
Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet. The discussions are still in preliminary stages, and the specific details havent been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767, accounting for a combined 15% of the aircraft. Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20% and 25% under the new program. If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767, the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s.
A seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold for $350,000, down $16,000 from the previous sale last Friday. Seats currently are quoted at $331,000, bid, and $350,000, asked. The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $550,000, set Aug. 31, 1987.
Alleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $150 million. The Sacramento-based S&L, which has 44 branch offices in north central California, had assets of $2.4 billion at the end of September. New York-based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern. The purchase price includes two ancillary companies.
The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants. Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimers, Parkinsons and Huntingtons. But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions. James Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research should be continued indefinitely. He said the ban wont stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that doesnt involve transplants. Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Masons ruling, which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health. Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion, as does President Bush, except in cases where a womans life is threatened. The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinsons disease. The department placed a moratorium on the research, pending a review of scientific, legal and ethical issues. A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions, but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding. The dispute has hampered the administrations efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control. Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants. Antonio Novello, whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general, reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion. Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts. Earlier this week, Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by standards of scientific and administrative excellence, not politics. But the administrations handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists. When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground, there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications, says Myron Genel, associate dean of the Yale Medical School. The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized, so that no mechanism exists for finding a middle ground. Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants. But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Masons ruling may discourage private funding. The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made, certainly dont provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support, he said. Despite the flap over transplants, federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts. Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer or to regulate genes that cause Downs syndrome, the leading cause of mental retardation, according to an NIH summary. The NIH currently spends about $8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $8 billion.

LSI Logic Corp. reported a surprise $35.7 million third-quarter net loss, including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand. In September, the custom-chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $2 million to $3 million net loss for the third quarter. But company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations, citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques. Over the summer months, there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector, our primary market, said Wilfred J. Corrigan, chairman and chief executive officer. In addition, recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment, at least until midyear. As a result, the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and make appropriate reductions in operating expenses. The $35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share. Not counting the extraordinary charge, the company said it would have had a net loss of $3.1 million, or seven cents a share. A year earlier, it had profit of $7.5 million, or 18 cents a share. Revenue rose 42% to $133.7 million from $94 million. The charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips. Related to that decision, the company said it was converting its Santa Clara, Calif., factory to a research and development facility. A spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force. This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned, said Michael Stark, chip analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Co. I think the stock is dead money for a while. Yesterdays announcement was made after markets closed. U.S. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer. Part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy.
INGERSOLL-RAND Co. (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.) -- William G. Kuhns, former chairman and chief executive officer of General Public Utilities Corp., was elected a director of this maker of industrial and construction equipment, increasing board membership to 10.
The Cosby Show may have single-handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984, and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network. But some of the TV stations that bought Cosby reruns for record prices two years ago arent laughing much these days. The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows. But the ratings are considerably below expectations, and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire. Meanwhile, stations are fuming because, many of them say, the shows distributor, Viacom Inc., is giving an ultimatum: Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing Cosby to a competitor. At the same time, Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to A Different World, a spin-off of Cosby whose reruns will become available in 1991. Viacom denies its using pressure tactics. Were willing to negotiate, says Dennis Gillespie, executive vice president of marketing. Were offering this plan now because we feel its the right time. But, says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest, I think if I tell them I need more time, theyll take `Cosby across the street, Viacoms move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks. One station manager says he believes Viacoms move is a pre-emptive strike because the company is worried that Cosby ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years. Cosby is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising. And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington; Providence, R.I.; Cleveland; Raleigh, N.C.; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say they may very well not renew Cosby. Dick Lobo, the general manager of WTVJ, the NBC-owned station in Miami, for example, says the show has been a major disappointment to us. At the prices we were charged, there should have been some return for the dollar. There wasnt. Neil Kuvin, the general manager of WHAS, the CBS affiliate in Louisville, says Cosby gets the stations highest ratings and hes pleased. But he adds, I feel pressured, disappointed, uncomfortable and, frankly, quite angry with Viacom.
The Life Insurance Co. of Georgia has officially opened an office in Taipei. David Wu, the companys representative in Taiwan, said Atlanta-based Life of Georgia will sell conventional life-insurance products. Life of Georgia is part of the Nationale Nederlanden Group, based in the Netherlands.
Sea Containers Ltd. said it might increase the price of its $70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd., which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers. Sea Containers, a Hamilton, Bermuda-based shipping concern, said Tuesday that it would sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns, Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC. In May, the two companies, through their jointly owned holding company, Temple, offered $50 a share, or $777 million, for Sea Containers. In August, Temple sweetened the offer to $63 a share, or $963 million. Yesterday, Sea Containers chief executive officer, James Sherwood, said in an interview that, under the asset-sale plan, Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $620 million. About $490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back, leaving about $130 million, he said. That $130 million, Mr. Sherwood said, gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid. We are able to increase our price above the $70 level if necessary. He declined to say, however, how much Sea Containers might raise its price. Mr. Sherwood speculated that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to substantially increase their bid if theyre going to top us. Temple, however, harshly criticized Sea Containers plan yesterday, characterizing it as a highly conditional device designed to entrench management, confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer. A spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $36 to $45 a share in cash. The lower figures, the spokesman said, would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market. Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda, where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook. {The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.} Temple also said Sea Containers plan raises numerous legal, regulatory, financial and fairness issues, but didnt elaborate. Mr. Sherwood said reaction to Sea Containers proposal has been very positive. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sea Containers closed at $62.625, up 62.5 cents.
The Transportation Department, responding to pressure from safety advocates, took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles. The department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans, beginning with 1992 models. It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year. Such belts already are required for the vehicles front seats. Todays action, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said, represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards. In September, the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars. The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes werent surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans. Safety advocates, including some members of Congress, have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans, which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars. They didnt have much luck during the Reagan administration. But now, there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem, said Chuck Hurley, vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Were in a very different regulatory environment. Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) praised the departments actions, noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths. We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards, he said. Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans, including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection. The departments roof-crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less. The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle. During the test, the roof couldnt be depressed more than five inches. In Detroit, a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks, but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year. He said Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1, 1991, deadline. Chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars. John Leinonen, executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. s auto-safety office, said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982. Ford began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its F-series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year. The new Explorer sport-utility vehicle, set for introduction next spring, will also have the rear-seat belts. Mr. Leinonen said he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily.
Consolidated Rail Corp. said it would spend more than $30 million on 1,000 enclosed railcars for transporting autos. The multilevel railcars, scheduled for delivery in 1990, will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co., a Chicago Heights, Ill., division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc., Elmhurst, Ill. This year, the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars.
Sir Peter Walters, 58-year-old chairman of British Petroleum Co. until next March, joins the board of this cement products company on Dec. 1. Sir Peter will succeed Sir John Milne, 65, who retires as Blue Circle nonexecutive chairman on June 1.
Bank of New England Corp. said it has held talks with potential merger partners outside New England, although it added that nothing is imminent and it hasnt received any formal offers. The discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. Later yesterday, a Massachusetts senate committee approved a bill to allow national interstate banking by banks in the state beginning in 1991. Currently, both Massachusetts and Connecticut, where most of Bank of New Englands operations are, allow interstate banking only within New England. Richard Driscoll, vice chairman of Bank of New England, told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, Certainly, there are those outside the region who think of us prospectively as a good partner. We have, and Im sure others have, considered what our options are, and weve had conversations with people who in the future might prove to be interesting partners. He added, Theres nothing very hot. Mr. Driscoll didnt elaborate about who the potential partners were or when the talks were held. A bank spokeswoman also declined to comment on any merger-related matters, but said the company decided to drop its opposition to the interstate banking legislation because prevailing sentiment is in favor of passage. Bank of New England has been hit hard by the regions real-estate slump, with its net income declining 42% to $121.6 million, or 61 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1989 from the year-earlier period. The company recently said it would sell some operations and lay off 4% of its work force, altogether reducing employment to less than 16,000 from about 18,000. It recently signed a preliminary agreement to negotiate exclusively with the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. for the sale of part of its leasing business to the Japanese bank.
GOODY PRODUCTS Inc. cut its quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 11.5 cents a share. The reduced dividend is payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 15. The Kearny, N.J.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $992,000, or 15 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported net income of $1.9 million, or 29 cents a share. The company also adopted an anti-takeover plan.
Michael Henderson, 51-year-old group chief executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker, will become chairman in May, succeeding Ian Butler, 64, who is retiring. Mr. Butler will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director.
Rallys Inc. said it has redeemed its rights outstanding issued Monday in its shareholder rights plan. The company said holders of stock of record Nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment. The fast-food company said its decision was based upon discussions with a shareholder group, Giant Group Ltd., in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company. Giant Group is led by three Rallys directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II, who last month indicated they hold a 42.5% stake in Rallys and plan to seek a majority of seats on Rallys nine-member board.
Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates, but it isnt clear whether the central bank will do so. A survey by the Feds 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks, while upward pressures on prices have moderated. The economy is clearly slowing, says Robert Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank. If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5% growth, I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter, agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey. Nevertheless, both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern. Were coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur, said Mr. Guffey. Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates, and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well. I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date, said Robert Johnson, vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co. The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75% after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, but has shown no sign of movement since. The report from the Fed found that manufacturing, in particular, has been weak in recent weeks. The Philadelphia Fed, for instance, reported that manufacturing activity continues to decline for the fourth month in a row. And in the Chicago district, the report said, a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types, including defense equipment, petroleum equipment, food packaging machinery and material handling equipment. Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts, particularly for discretionary, big-ticket items such as furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics. And construction also was described as slow in most areas. Despite the economic slowdown, there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt. As a result, Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit. Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move. Mr. Black said he is pleased with the economys recent performance, and doesnt see a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession. There is always a chance of recession, added Mr. Guffey, but if you ask me to put a percentage on it, I would think its well below a 50% chance.
Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co. said its planned rights offering to raise about $9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week. Under the offer, shareholders will receive one right for each 105 common shares owned. Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $100 face amount of 13.5% bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share. The rights, which expire Nov. 21, can be exercised for $100 each. Integra, which owns and operates hotels, said that Hallwood Group Inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that arent exercised by other shareholders. Hallwood, a Cleveland merchant bank, owns about 11% of Integra.
Copperweld Corp., a specialty steelmaker, said 445 workers at a plant in Shelby, Ohio, began a strike after the United Steelworkers Local 3057 rejected a new contract on Tuesday. The previous contract between Copperwelds Ohio Steel Tube division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday. The union vote to reject the proposed pact was 230-215. Copperweld said it doesnt expect a protracted strike. It said it has taken measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage.
The Treasury said it plans to sell $30 billion in notes and bonds next week, but said the auctions will be postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling. Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled. Unless it can raise money in financial markets, Mr. Basham said, the federal government wont have the cash to pay off $13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday. Without congressional action, the Treasury cant sell any new securities -- even savings bonds. But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling, which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes, Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default. Each day that Congress fails to act . . . will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers. To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative. The securities to be sold next week will raise about $10 billion in cash and redeem $20 billion in maturing notes. The new securities, part of the federal governments regular quarterly refunding, will consist of: -- $10 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1992. -- $10 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1999. -- $10 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned Thursday and to mature Aug. 15, 2019. The Treasury also said it plans to sell $10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday. They will mature Dec. 21. None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling, clearing the way for a formal offering, Mr. Basham said. The Treasury said it needs to raise $47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $20 billion cash balance. Auctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $25.6 billion. The remaining $21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills, two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December, the Treasury said. In the first three months of 1990, the Treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion, assuming that it decides to aim for a $10 billion cash balance at the end of March.
Lancaster Colony Corp. said it acquired Reames Foods Inc. in a cash transaction. Terms werent disclosed. Reames, a maker and marketer of frozen noodles and pre-cooked pasta based in Clive, Iowa, has annual sales of about $11 million, Lancaster said.
Investors took advantage of Tuesdays stock rally to book some profits yesterday, leaving stocks up fractionally. Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished less than a point higher to close at 2645.90 in moderate trading. But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were tidily ahead of declining stocks, 847 to 644. Long-term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month. Continuing demand for dollars from Japanese investors boosted the U.S. currency. Analysts were disappointed that the enthusiasm investors showed for stocks in the wake of Georgia-Pacifics $3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa evaporated so quickly. The industrial average jumped more than 41 points Tuesday as speculators rushed to buy shares of potential takeover targets. But with the end of the year in sight, money managers are eager to take profits and cut their risks of losing what for many have been exceptionally good returns in Economic news had little effect on financial markets. As expected, a national purchasing managers report indicated the nations manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly. The Federal Reserves Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions across the country, indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth. In major market activity: Stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading. Big Board volume totaled 154.2 million shares. Bond prices were up. The Treasurys benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield fell to 7.88%. The dollar rose. In late afternoon New York trading the currency was at 1.8500 marks and 143.80 yen compared with 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen.
Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. posted a 62% rise in pretax profit to 5.276 billion yen ($36.9 million) in its fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 compared with 3.253 billion yen a year earlier. Net income more than tripled to 4.898 billion yen from 1.457 billion yen a year earlier.
Eaton Corp. said it sold its Pacific Sierra Research Corp. unit to a company formed by employees of that unit. Terms werent disclosed.

Eaton is an automotive parts, controls and aerospace electronics concern.
Investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries Inc. offered to acquire Georgia Gulf Corp. for $50 a share, or about $1.1 billion, stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals concern. The offer follows an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $55 a share. Georgia Gulf rebuffed that offer in September and said it would study other alternatives. However, it hasnt yet made any proposals to shareholders. Late yesterday, Georgia Gulf said it reviewed the NL proposal as well as interests from third parties regarding business combinations. Georgia Gulf said it hasnt eliminated any alternatives and that discussions are being held with interested parties, and work is also continuing on other various transactions. It didnt elaborate. Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons, an aggressive and persistent investor, wont leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed. He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull, says Paul Leming, a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Co. He appears to be in it for the long haul. Mr. Simmons and NL already own a 9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf. Mr. Simmons owns 88% of Valhi Inc., which in turn owns two-thirds of NL. NL is officially making the offer. Mr. Leming wasnt surprised by the lower price cited by NL, saying he believes that $55 a share is the most you can pay for Georgia Gulf before it becomes a bad acquisition. Georgia Gulf stock rose $1.75 a share yesterday to close at $51.25 a share, while NL shares closed unchanged at $22.75 and Valhi rose 62.5 cents to $15, all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. J. Landis Martin, NL president and chief executive officer, said NL and Mr. Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt. However, the junk-bond market has collapsed in recent weeks, lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed. Now, he said, the group plans to put in several hundred million dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt. He also said that the group reduced its offer because it wasnt allowed to see Georgia Gulfs confidential financial information without agreeing that it wouldnt make an offer unless it had Georgia Gulfs consent. In a letter to Georgia Gulf President Jerry R. Satrum, Mr. Martin asked Georgia Gulf to answer its offer by Tuesday. It wasnt clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond if Georgia Gulf spurns them again. Mr. Martin said they havent yet decided what their next move would be, but he didnt rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulfs board. In other transactions, Mr. Simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer. Although Georgia Gulf hasnt been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL, a specialty chemicals concern, the group apparently believes the companys management is interested in some kind of transaction. The management group owns about 18% of the stock, most purchased at nominal prices, and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold. In the third quarter, Georgia Gulf earned $46.1 million, or $1.85 a share, down from $53 million, or $1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding. Sales fell to $251.2 million from $278.7 million.
A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine. University Patents Inc., based in Westport, Conn., said it seeks Johnson & Johnsons profits from sales of Retin-A, estimated at $50 million, a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere. In May, University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman, a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne. Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University, but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson. In New Brunswick, N.J., a Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined comment.
Hudson General Corp. s president and chief executive officer, Alan J. Stearn, resigned. Mr. Stearn, 46 years old, couldnt be reached for comment. A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure. Hudson General, which provides maintenance, fueling and other services to airlines and airports, reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares. Mr. Stearn, who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984, will act as a consultant to Hudson General. His duties as chief executive will be assumed by Chairman Jay B. Langner.
SHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares. The Chandler, Ariz., company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.

Five things you can do for $15,000 or less: 1. Buy a new Chevrolet. 2. Take a Hawaiian vacation. 3. Send your child to a university. 4. Buy a diamond necklace. 5. Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan. Americans today spend $15,000 like pocket change -- they dont think much about it. But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise. Your $15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit. As a Foster Corporate Parent, youll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival. Like healthy regulatory capital. A steady deposit base. Performing loans. At the same time, youll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good. As a Foster Corporate Parent, you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass, Lewis Ranieri, William Simon and others, who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves. That builds confidence, self sufficiency, not to mention critical regulatory net worth. Dont wait -- a savings institution needs your help now! Every day you delay, a savings institutions health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse. Think about the good you can do for just $15,000 a month, about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university. Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line. Every $15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit! Mr. Baris is a lawyer in New York.
Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bells offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. Such is hardly the case. Bells father-in-law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well-connected, obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York. This is where Bells patents went. Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business. It acquired Thomas Edisons microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather, Emile Berliner, which had been sold to Bell for a princely $50,000, infringed upon Western Unions Edison patent. When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edisons application, Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the companys current plight.

Troubled NBI Inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations. The ailing company, which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters, said it wont manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force. Altogether, NBI said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters, 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters. The companys work force will fall to about 400 people. Stephen G. Jerritts, president and chief executive officer, said customers werent willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the companys financial troubles. Further, he said, the company doesnt have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two. We flat ran out of financing resources, Mr. Jerritts said. We had to do something structurally and radically different. As a result, he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems, trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business, using some of the applications it developed for its hardware. The company currently offers a word-processing package for personal computers called Legend. The company, which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock, said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NBI common closed at 93 cents a share, up 31 cents.
Your Oct. 6 article Japans Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates states, Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing Japans economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees. The Japanese industrial companies should know better. They are barking up the wrong tree, because it is basically their fault they cant attract new employees. Takuma Yamamoto, president of Fujitsu Ltd., believes the `money worship among young people . . . caused the problem. He is just passing the buck to young people. Whats wrong with asking for more money? Money is not everything, but it is necessary, and business is not volunteer work. It is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job. Unfortunately, Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages. I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful. I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers, but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them. Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images, but they should realize that the most important thing is real change, not changing peoples perceptions. If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival, they could do at least three things to improve the situation: raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions; improve working conditions (better offices and more vacations, for example); accept and hire more labor from outside Japan.

In reference to your Oct. 9 page-one article Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President, it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives: Among liberals, 60% have positive views of her, while 50% approve of the presidents job performance. In part, this may reflect the fact that `she speaks a more progressive language than her husband, as Columbias Prof. {Ethel} Klein puts it. Among professionals, 76% have a favorable opinion of her, compared to 62% who approve of her husbands performance. While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bushs handling of his job, only 15% have a negative view of his spouse. The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bushs job performance and 85% of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush. If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful, the positive view is even more newsworthy. Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious, stereotyped perspective. Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator. Preston G. Foster Birmingham, Ala.
The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush. The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor. Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs. But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress, after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise. So both sides accepted the compromise, which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977, raising the wage to $3.35 an hour from $2.65. Under the measure passed yesterday, the minimum wage would rise to $3.80 next April. The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it. There are no smiles about this bill, Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.) said during House floor debate yesterday. But because its all weve got, Im going to vote for it. While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, Mr. Williams said. But Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.) instead praised the Houses acceptance of a new youth training wage, a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years. Adopting a training-wage policy means getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage, Mrs. Roukema said. Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage, but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force. Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea, but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence. The compromise sets the training wage at $3.35 an hour next April, and at $3.61 an hour, or 85% of the minimum wage, in April 1991. Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days, without restriction, to workers with less than six months of job experience, and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers. The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old. The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, still opposed to any mininum-wage increase, said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27% in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers.
Zenith Data Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp., received a $534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period. Rockwell International Corp. won a $130.7 million Air Force contract for AC-130U gunship replacement aircraft. Martin Marietta Corp. was given a $29.9 million Air Force contract for low-altitude navigation and targeting equipment. Federal Data Corp. got a $29.4 million Air Force contract for intelligence data handling.
The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants, and proposed $7.3 million in fines, the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer. The departments Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $6.1 million for alleged violations at the companys Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility. OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical, crane-safety, record-keeping and other requirements. A second citation covering the companys Clairton, Pa., coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements, for which OSHA proposed $1.2 million in fines. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health, and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards. OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972. Gerard Scannell, the head of OSHA, said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards. Particularly flagrant, Mrs. Dole said, are the companys numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works, in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies. That settlement was in April 1987. A USX spokesman said the company hadnt yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine. Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation, the spokesman said. No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees. USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works. He said that, if and when safety problems were identified, they were corrected. The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell. He has promised stiffer fines, though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year. The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants, said Linda Anku, OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia. USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties, before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Before the USX case, OSHAs largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati. The company is contesting the fine.

ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars (US$148.9 million to $153.3 million) through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares. Perpetual preferred shares arent retractable by the holders, the company said. Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares, but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place. A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate hasnt yet been fixed, but will probably be set at around 8%. He declined to discuss other terms of the issue.
The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy-outs. The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor. The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry, but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto. The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue. While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs, the measure hasnt yet come to the full floor. Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline, it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt. The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carriers ability to compete, Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, (R., Ark.) said. The bill, as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15% or more of the stock in an airline. The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished; it would be put into foreign control; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit. The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) that would, in addition to the previous criteria, also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carriers employees, or their wages or benefits. Rep. James Traficant (D., Ohio), said the amendment, which passed 271-147, would let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally. But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision, which he dubbed a special interest amendment, was likely to make the bill even more controversial. On Tuesday, the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The provision, called the two-time-losers amendment by its supporters, apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline.

Robert L. Bernstein, chairman and president of Random House Inc., announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years. A successor wasnt named, which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family company, Advance Publications Inc., owns Random House. Abrupt departures arent unheard of within the Newhouse empire. In an interview, Mr. Bernstein said his departure evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and thats the decision I reached. He declined to elaborate, other than to say, It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute. Sometimes you just go with your gut. Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor, who is to be named soon. Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, insisted that he isnt unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House, the largest trade publishing house in the U.S. The company said the publishers annual sales volume increased to $800 million from $40 million during Mr. Bernsteins tenure. Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly, said Mr. Newhouse. The company is doing well, its stable, its got good people. Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time. Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years, some of the bigger ones havent been absorbed so easily. Crown Publishing Group, acquired last year, is said to be turning in disappointing results. As a private company, Random House doesnt report its earnings. Mr. Bernstein, who succeeded Bennett Cerf, has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925. Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house. Possible candidates include Susan Petersen, president of Ballantine/Del Rey/ Fawcett, Random Houses huge and successful paperback division. Some say Anthony Cheetham, head of a recently acquired British company, Century Hutchinson, could be chosen. There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side, in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb, who left Random Houses Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker, also owned by the Newhouse family. Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans, recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit. When Ms. Evans took her job, several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor werent included partly because she didnt wish to be a full-time administrator. Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently. Mr. Bernstein, a tall, energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive, has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues.
Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record, net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $59.9 billion last year. The previous record was $57.7 billion in 1987, according to the Agriculture Department. Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988, as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices, the departments Economic Research Service reported yesterday. Most of those states set farm income records. The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains. What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had mortgaged to the government under price-support loan programs. With prices soaring, they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at considerable profit, the agencys 240-page report said. In less parched areas, meanwhile, farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices. To the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states, including Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and the Dakotas. Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress. Last years record net cash income confirms the farm sectors rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s. It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year. Commodity prices have been rising in recent years, with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year, as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses. At the same time, export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said Keith Collins, a department analyst. Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices, as the nations cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low. All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture, Mr. Collins said. California led the nation with $6.5 billion in net cash income last year, followed by Texas, $3.9 billion; Iowa, $3.4 billion; Florida, $3.1 billion; and Minnesota, $2.7 billion. Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income. Despite federal disaster relief, the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers, according to the department. Many lost their farms. Department economists dont expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was. Indeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline. At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets. Last year, government payments to farmers slipped to less than $14.5 billion from a record $16.7 billion in 1987. Payments are expected to range between $9 billion and $12 billion this year.
Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it didnt make a $1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures. The radio-station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions. It said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt. In September, the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business.
The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks. The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions. As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities. An appeal is expected. In response to the ruling, gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session. Gilts, or British government bonds, which also fell sharply initially, retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower. The council, which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over #6 billion ($9.5 billion), lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals. At one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings. When two parties engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on future rates. Thus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments. In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate payments. As interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them. The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils arent vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities. The council backed the audit commissions stand that the swap transactions are illegal. Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions, the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils. While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature, a solicitor representing one of the banks said. Already, 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings. Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, Security Pacific Corp., Chemical Banking Corp. s Chemical Bank, Citicorps Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International. If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal, it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways, some market sources said. Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils. Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable. The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly.
Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years. The funding mechanism, which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush, would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million the Bush administrations request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. To offset the reduction, Congress approved a $20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers, acquisitions and certain other transactions. Some Democrats, led by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts. But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them. It could operate to augment our budget, James Rill, the Justice Departments antitrust chief, said in an interview. Under measures approved by both houses of Congress, the administrations request for $47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $15 million. The FTC budget request of $70 million, about $34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement, would also be cut by $15 million. The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989. The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Under that law, parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions. Currently, the government charges nothing for such filings. Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million this fiscal year, or $10 million more than the budget cuts. When you do that, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million each for the FTC and the Justice Department, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa) said during House debate. But Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, reducing the amount of fees collected. The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40% in the Reagan administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period. Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen, Mr. Edwards argued. Any money in excess of $40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large. Corporate lawyers said the new fees wouldnt inhibit many mergers or other transactions. Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect, government officials said they hadnt noticed any surge in filings.
Youngs Market Co., a wholesaler of spirits, wines and other goods, said it will merge with a new corporation formed by the Underwood family, which controls Youngs. Under terms of the agreement, shareholders other than the Underwoods will receive $3,500 a share at closing, which is expected in December. The Underwood family said that holders of more than a majority of the stock of the company have approved the transaction by written consent.
Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. s Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100, moving the materials closer to commercial use. The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field. The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature, or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit. Their report appears in todays issue of the journal Nature. The finding marks a significant step in research on bulk superconductors, which are aimed at use in wires for motors, magnets, generators and other applications. Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors, but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry. Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled. A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised. The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome. But it wont lead to imminent use of new superconductors, cautioned Robert B. van Dover, one of the AT&T researchers. He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals. Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications. Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons, a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use. Still, scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding, because it demonstrates how to overcome the flux pinning problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors potential. The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals, limiting their current-carrying capacity. Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place, preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity. Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem. Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns. The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with melt-textured growth, a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories. The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples.
William C. Walbrecher Jr., an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank, was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit, Fidelity Federal Bank. The appointment takes effect Nov. 13. He succeeds James A. Taylor, who stepped down as chairman, president and chief executive in March for health reasons. Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman. Separately, Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.3 million, or 68 cents a share, versus net income of $5.3 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier. The latest results include some unusual write-downs, which had an after-tax impact of $4.9 million. Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition, which was terminated on Sept. 27, 1989. In addition, operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves. In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Citadel shares closed yesterday at $45.75, down 25 cents.
Although his team lost the World Series, San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them. He is an avid fan of a proposition on next weeks ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park. Small wonder, since hes asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $100 million into the new stadium. As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One, opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium. A stadium craze is sweeping the country. Its fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams. Something like one-third of the nations 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg. Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city. Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that. He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out. Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community, not create more of it. Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium. San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago. Last month, Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $100 million stadium bond and tax proposition. Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media -- and spent $100,000 on promotion. But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself, and rejected it 59% to 41%. In San Francisco, its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls. George Christopher, the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s, wont endorse the new ballpark. He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces. Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces, Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal games of their own with the voters. Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built. Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees, and he can prove it. Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl, and instead built his own $100 million coliseum with private funds. He didnt see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit. This stadium shows that anything government can do, we can do better, Mr. Robbie says. But to Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that citys cavernous, money-losing Superdome, questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance. The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith, he has said. It is the very building of it that is important, not how much of it is used or its economics. An Egyptian Pharaoh couldnt have justified his pyramids any better. But civilization has moved forward since then. Today taxpayers get to vote, most of the time, on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs, or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions.
Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5% to #89.7 million ($141.9 million), or 16 pence a share, from #94.8 million ($149.9 million), or 17.3 pence a share. The British paper, packaging and publishing concern, said profit from continuing lines fell 10% to #118 million from #130.6 million. While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period, there was a one-time gain of #18 million in the 1988 period. And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations, last year they contributed #34 million, before tax. Pretax profit fell 3.7% to #128 million from #133 million and was below analysts expectations of #130 million to #135 million, but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London. Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence, up 15% from 4 pence a year earlier. Sales fell 20% to #722 million. Earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring, Reed said.
Lewis C. Veraldi, the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, retired early after experiencing recent heart problems. Most recently, Mr. Veraldi, 59 years old, has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co. But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the companys Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. s Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. Under the so-called Team Taurus approach, Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers, assembly-line workers, auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle. The concepts goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Fords product development more responsive to consumer demands. It was later applied to other new-car programs, including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar. Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has helped to change the worlds perception of American-made cars. Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years, holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions.
Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership, an investment firm, completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co. s Caldor discount chain for $500 million plus the assumption of $52 million in debt. Caldor, based in Norwalk, Conn., operates 118 stores in the Northeast; it reported revenue of $1.6 billion last year. May Stores, St. Louis, runs such well-known department stores as Lord & Taylor.
N.V. DSM said net income in the third quarter jumped 63% as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program. The Dutch chemical group said net income gained to 235 million guilders ($113.2 million), or 6.70 guilders a share, from 144 million guilders, or 4.10 guilders a share, a year ago. The 32% state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter, mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations. The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the companys construction division. Last year, DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions. The earnings growth also was fueled by the companys ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders. Also, substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth, the company added. Sales, however, were little changed at 2.46 billion guilders, compared with 2.42 billion guilders.
Allergan Inc. said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens, the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery. The lens foldability enables it to be inserted in smaller incisions than are now possible for cataract surgery, the eye care and skin care concern said. Cataracts refer to a clouding of the eyes natural lens. Allergan was spun off in July from SmithKline Beckman Corp. as part of the merger of SmithKline and Beecham Group
A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday to talk about the U.S.s intention to send some $100 million in food aid to Poland, with more to come from the EC. The committees members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Polands own farmers. Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt. However well intentioned, food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient countrys own farmers. The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other peoples economies with this kind of unfocused kindness. It should be constantly stressed that Polands farmers mostly need a real market for their products.
Elco Industries Inc. said it expects net income in the year ending June 30, 1990, to fall below a recent analysts estimate of $1.65 a share. The Rockford, Ill., maker of fasteners also said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are slightly above fiscal 1989 sales of $155 million. The company said its industrial unit continues to face margin pressures and lower demand. In fiscal 1989, Elco earned $7.8 million, or $1.65 a share. The companys stock fell $1.125 to $13.625 in over-the-counter trading yesterday.
Oshkosh Truck Corp., Oshkosh, Wis., estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 50% to 75% below the year-earlier $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share. The truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year. In fiscal 1988, the company earned $17.3 million, or $1.92 a share, on revenue of $352.9 million. Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations. The company said it is in the process of phasing out John Deere, its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis. In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period.

Criminal charges were filed against Diceon Electronics Inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its Chatsworth, Calif., facility. The Los Angeles County district attorneys office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine, Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid, caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system, and stored hazardous materials in leaky, unlabeled or open-top containers. Named as defendants were Roland Matthews, president, and Peter Jonas, executive vice president and chief financial officer, as well as a former plant manager. The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to routine inspection in August. The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court. Arraignments are scheduled for Nov. 14.
Consumer confidence stayed strong in October, despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market. The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers, said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Boards consumer research center. Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event. The nonprofit, industry-supported group said its Consumer Confidence Index was 116.4 in October, barely changed from a revised 116.3 in September. The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7. It uses a base of 100 in 1985. In October, more people said that present business conditions were good than in September. An equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good. And 19.6% of consumers contacted believed business conditions will improve in the coming six months, compared with 18.3% in September. Also, more people said conditions will worsen in the period. (Fewer said conditions wont change.) In October 1988, 21.1% said business conditions would improve. In October 1989, 16.9% said more jobs will be created in the coming six months, compared with 17.4% in September and 18.6% in October 1988. Only 26.8% in October, compared with 28.5% in September and 26.8% in October 1988, said income would increase. The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumers day-to-day economic life, said Mr. Linden. Unemployment continues at a relatively low level, providing a sense of job security, and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong. The consumer confidence survey, covering 5,000 U.S. households, is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the Conference Board by National Family Opinion Inc., a Toledo, Ohio, market researcher. Buying plans were mixed in October, with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months. In October, 6.7% of respondents said they will buy a car, easing from September when 8.1% anticipated a purchase. In October 1988, 7.3% said they would buy a car. Home purchase plans increased to 3.3% from 3.1% in the two recent months. In October 1988, 3.7% said they would buy a house. In 1989, home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9% to 3.7% of respondents. In October, 30.6% said they will buy appliances in the coming six months, compared with 27.4% in September and 26.5% in October 1988.
Standard & Poors Corp. lowered to double-C from triple-C the rating on about $130 million of debt. The rating concern said the textile and clothing companys interest expense exceeds operating profit by a wide margin and it noted Uniteds estimated after-tax loss of $24 million for the year ended June 30.
Travelers Corp. s third-quarter net income rose 11%, even though claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo reduced results $40 million. Net advanced to $94.2 million, or 89 cents a share, from $85 million, or 83 cents a share, including net realized investment gains of $31 million, up from $10 million a year ago. But revenue declined to $3 billion from $3.2 billion. Travelers estimated that the California earthquake last month will result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of less than $10 million. The insurers earnings from commercial property/casualty lines fell 59% in the latest quarter, while it lost $7.2 million in its personal property/casualty business, compared with earnings of $6.1 million a year ago. Travelerss employee benefits group, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted earnings of $24 million, compared with a loss of $3 million last year. In the first nine months, net was $306 million, compared with a loss of $195 million in the 1988 period. The year-ago results included a $415 million charge in the 1988 second quarter for underperforming real estate and mortgage loans.
The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLCs planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd. The department said it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchases possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires. BTR PLC, a U.K. industrial conglomerate, said in June it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd., a U.K. unit of the tire maker, for #140 million ($221.4 million). Michelin Tyre is a unit of Frances Michelin S.A. Michelin officials couldnt immediately comment on the referral, but they noted the purchase from BTR has already been concluded. National Tyre, which has 420 branches throughout the U.K., had 1988 pretax profit of #8.5 million.
Rep. John Dingell, an important sponsor of President Bushs clean-air bill, plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue: acid rain. The Michigan Democrats proposal, which is expected today, is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administrations plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain. The administrations plan could cost utilities, mainly those that use coal, up to $4 billion a year. The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the Houses work on clean-air legislation. As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation. People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingells proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain, though additional cuts could be ordered later. Mr. Bushs legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000. Although final details werent available, sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the presidents proposal for a cap on utilities sulfur-dioxide emissions. That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth. It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters. In addition, it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country, sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills. The administration, sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases, has staunchly opposed cost-sharing. Mr. Dingells staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members, apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing. It isnt clear, however, whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White Houses acid-rain plan. While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels. Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns.
American City Business Journals Inc. said its president, Michael K. Russell, will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Russell, who co-founded the Kansas City, Mo.-based local business publications concern here, said he would have a five-year consulting agreement with the company, which recently underwent an ownership change. Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc., Charlotte, acquired 30% of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25% from E.W. Scripps Co. next year. Ray Shaw, chairman of American City, said he would assume Mr. Russells responsibilities if a successor isnt found this month.
New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15% of United Airlines parent, UAL Corp., saying he might seek control of the nations second-largest airline. Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself, the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid. Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control. But some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings, which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold. Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it doesnt mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control. Maybe he just wants to make something happen, said one takeover expert. One investment banker said Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid. Mr. Steinberg, he suggested, could replace British Airways PLC, which has withdrawn from the buy-out group. Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $6.79 billion, $300-a-share labor-management buy-out. Reliance acquired a 7% UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $110 a share, and reduced its stake to 4.7% after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $282 a share. Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake, and thus wouldnt have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock. But the exact amount of Reliances current holding hasnt been formally disclosed. The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners, a New York money manager, has bought more than 5% of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL boards decision last week to remain independent. Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $145. UALs announcement came after the market closed yesterday. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, the shares closed at $177, up $1.50. UAL wouldnt elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance. Reliance confirmed the filing but wouldnt elaborate. Some takeover experts were skeptical, saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL. Mr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UALs Mr. Wolf. The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc. Mr. Wolfs success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987. But any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the companys employees, primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists union, which has opposed a takeover.
A.L. Williams Corp. was merged into Primerica Corp., New York, after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction, the companies said. Primerica, which had owned nearly 70% of Williams, will pay about 16.7 million shares, currently valued at almost $472 million, for the rest of Williams. The financial-services company will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share. Williams shares, which were to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after the close of composite trading yesterday, closed at $23.25, off 12.5 cents. Primerica closed at $28.25, down 50 cents. Williams, Duluth, Ga., is an insurance and financial-services holding company. Its subsidiaries services are marketed by closely held A.L. Williams & Associates. Primerica, as expected, also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities. Terms werent disclosed.
Intelogic Trace Inc., San Antonio, Texas, said it bought 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million. The move boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelmans stake to 20% from 16.2% and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern. Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp., an Intelogic affiliate. The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including the possible sale of the company. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $2.75. Mr. Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves, saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when the company is on a roll. He added, This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed, particularly, to take the company private. But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back, and the above-market price paid, prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared.
Dow Jones & Co. said it extended its $18-a-share offer for Telerate Inc. common stock until 5 p.m. EST Nov. 9. The offer, valued at about $576 million for the 33% of Telerate that Dow Jones doesnt already own, had been set to expire Nov. 6. Dow Jones, which owns about 64 million of Telerates 95 million common shares outstanding, said that about 24,000 shares have been tendered under its offer. Telerates two independent directors have rejected the offer as inadequate. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telerate shares closed at $19.50, up 12.5 cents. Telerate provides an electronic financial information network. Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barrons magazine, and community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases.
Rockwell International Corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. The aerospace, automotive supply, electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough. In an interview, Donald Beall, chairman, said first-half profit certainly would trail the past years, primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets. Still, he added, if the industrial sector remains relatively stable, Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989s operating profit of $630.9 million. For fiscal 1989s fourth quarter, Rockwells net income totaled $126.1 million, or 50 cents a share. That compares with operating earnings of $132.9 million, or 49 cents a share, the year earlier. The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business, which made net $185.9 million, or 70 cents a share. Sales rose 4% to $3.28 billion from $3.16 billion. Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the companys electronics segment. Overall, pretax electronics earnings soared 12% to $107.9 million from $96.4 million. All four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30. For the year, electronics emerged as Rockwells largest sector in terms of sales and earnings, muscling out aerospace for the first time. The graphics business, which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive, saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79% to $42.1 million from $23.5 million. For the year, bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press, graphics earnings almost doubled. Aerospace earnings sagged 37% for the quarter and 15% for the year, largely due to lower B-1B program profit; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988. That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines. The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship, according to analysts. For fiscal 1989, the company posted net of $734.9 million, or $2.87 a share, down from $811.9 million, or $3.04 a share, in fiscal 1988. Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year, earnings per share were $2.47, up 7.4% from $2.30 in fiscal 1988. Sales for the year rose 5% to $12.52 billion from $11.95 billion in fiscal 1988.
Dell Computer Corp. said it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5% to 17%. The Austin, Texas-based company, which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories, said its price cuts include a $100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory, a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor. That package now sells for about $2,099. A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor, with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $5,699, down from $6,799. Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors, which the Dell models use, generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen.
The parent of Younkers, after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores, said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing. Equitable of Iowa Cos., Des Moines, had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June, when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business. But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers fair value for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing. Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $313 million. It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska. Younkers management is likely to buy a 10% to 20% interest in the chain in January, said Fred S. Hubbell, Equitables president and chief executive officer. He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50%.
Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction. Under terms of the new proposal, Equus, managed by Equus Capital Corp., Houston, would pay $12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $1.65 a share for each of Tony Lamas 2.1 million shares outstanding. Previously, it offered $13.65 a share in cash, or $29 million. The El Paso, Texas, maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12% rate, but wouldnt be paid for the first two years. The stock would be redeemed in five years, subject to terms of the surviving companys debt. Neither Equus nor Tony Lama gave a reason for the changed offer and Tony Lama couldnt be reached for comment. However, Tony Lama said it would promptly submit the offer to a special committee of the companys board.
Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an amicable separation. Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services companys general manager for only six months. His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuterss editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupkes duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for personal reasons, which he declined to specify. There is no business reason for my departure, nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general managers post hadnt also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuterss eight-person executive committee who didnt also serve on the companys board of directors. If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board, he said. A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects no change in strategy or profits. Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, said, I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company. I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations. On Londons Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence ($14.43). In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at $43.875. The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupkes duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director. Peter Holland, 45, deputy general manager, becomes director of corporate affairs. And Patrick Mannix, 46, international technical manager, becomes director of group quality programs.
DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp. s Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd., extended to Nov. 20 its $45-a-share offer for all Dunkin Donuts Inc. shares outstanding. The offer, which was due to expire yesterday, is conditional on 50.1% of Dunkin common shares, on a fully diluted basis, being tendered and on the withdrawal of the companys poison pill rights plan. DD Acquisition has launched a suit in a Delaware court seeking the withdrawal of Dunkins poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans, which it claims were put in place to deter bidders. DD Acquisition said 2.2 million shares, or about 38.5% of the shares outstanding, have been tendered under its offer. The partners said they already hold 15% of all shares outstanding. Dunkin has set Nov. 10 as the deadline for the receipt of any competing bids. DD Acquisition said the extension is to allow this process to be completed. Dunkin is based in Randolph, Mass. Cara, a food services chain operator and Unicorp, a holding company, are based in Toronto.
Savin Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $35.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $3.8 million, or one cent a share. A spokesman for the Stamford, Conn.based company said operations had a loss of $5.5 million for the quarter; in addition, the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $23.5 million and $8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as unusual. The charges were partly offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures, he said. Revenue declined 8% to $85.7 million, from $93.3 million a year earlier. Savin cited a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes.
Hadson Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter net loss of $17 million to $19 million because of special reserves and continued low natural-gas prices. The Oklahoma City energy and defense concern said it will record a $7.5 million reserve for its defense group, including a $4.7 million charge related to problems under a fixed-price development contract and $2.8 million in overhead costs that wont be reimbursed. In addition, Hadson said it will write off about $3.5 million in costs related to international exploration leases where exploration efforts have been unsuccessful. The company also cited interest costs and amortization of goodwill as factors in the loss. A year earlier, net income was $2.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of $169.9 million.
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said it will convert its Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd. partnership into a publicly traded company through the exchange of units of the partnership for common shares. The company said the restructuring isnt expected to have any impact, adverse or otherwise, on its financial results. Freeport-McMoRan, a New Orleans-based diversified energy conglomerate, said the partnership will exchange its assets for common shares of a yet-to-be-formed entity. Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners will be liquidated and shares of the new company distributed to the partnerships unitholders. Unitholders will receive two additional 55 cents-a-unit distribution payments before the trust is liquidated in early 1990, the company said. It is expected that common shares equal to the number of units outstanding -- about 108 million on Sept. 30 -- will be issued during the first quarter of 1990. Freeport-McMoRan, the parent company, holds roughly 80% of the units outstanding.
Nissan Motor Co., Japans second-largest car maker, announced Wednesday that the parent concerns pretax earnings in the first half ended last Sept. 30 rose 14% to 88.32 billion yen ($618.1 million) from 77.6 billion yen a year earlier. Nissan cited strong domestic sales against the backdrop of continuous economic expansion. Profit surged 42% to 40.21 billion yen, or 16.09 yen a share, from 28.36 billion yen, or 11.72 yen a share. Sales totaled 1.916 trillion yen, climbing 17% from 1.637 trillion yen in the year-earlier period. Nissan scheduled a seven-yen interim dividend payment, unchanged. Atsushi Muramatsu, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nissan, said, The company has experienced a remarkable turnaround in terms of profitability since the fiscal year ending March 1987, when the sharp and rapid appreciation of the yen caused many difficulties. It can be said that the trend of financial improvement has been firmly set, he added.
Heritage Media Corp., New York, said it offered to buy the shares of POP Radio Corp. it doesnt already own in a stock swap. Heritage, which owns 51% of POPs 3.6 million shares outstanding, said it will exchange one share of a new preferred stock for each POP common share it doesnt already own. Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior to completion of the transaction, Heritage would issue between 1.8 million and 2.35 million preferred shares, a Heritage spokesman estimated. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, POP plunged $4 to $14.75. The preferred stock, which would have a dividend rate of $1.76 a year, would be convertible into Heritage common at a rate of four common shares for each preferred. New York-based POP Radio provides, through a national, in-store network, a customized music, information and advertising service which simulates live radio. Heritage owns and operates television and radio stations and in-store advertising and promotion programs.
GenCorp Inc., hurt by a plant accident and other unexpected costs, said it expects to report that fiscal fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations will be significantly below last years $25 million. The Fairlawn, Ohio-based company also said that full-year profit from continuing operations will be far below last years $148 million. Last years figures include a one-time loss of $12 million for restructuring and unusual items. But the automotive parts and aerospace concern expects that net for the year ending Nov. 30 will exceed last fiscal years net of $70 million, or $2.19 a share, primarily because of $200 million in gains from sales of discontinued operations. Harry Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co. in Cleveland, said GenCorps unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly plant in Kansas, run by a private subcontractor, that makes cluster bombs for GenCorps Aerojet Ordnance business. Transamerica Corp., San Francisco, said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier. The insurance and financial services concern said profit for the quarter rose 1.1% to $93.9 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with $92.9 million, or $1.18 a share, the year earlier. The results reflected a 24% gain in income from its finance businesses, and a 15% slide in income from insurance operations. Transamerica said third-quarter investment gains were $10.2 million, compared with $6.4 million the year earlier. It said insurance profit reflected a $6 million loss from Hurricane Hugo. It also estimated that losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California would be no more than $6 million, and would be included in fourth-quarter results.
RMS International Inc., Hasbrouk Heights, N.J., facing a cash-flow squeeze, said it is seeking other financing sources and waivers from debenture holders. The company said that because of softening sales it isnt in compliance with requirements that it maintain $3 million in working capital. RMS distributes electronic devices and produces power supplies and plastic literature displays. RMS said it had a loss of $158,666, or 10 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $26,956, or two cents a share. Sales rose to $3 million from $2.9 million. For the nine months, the company reported a net loss of $608,413, or 39 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $967,809, or 62 cents a share. Sales rose to $9.8 million from $8.9 million.
Meridian National Corp. said it sold 750,000 shares of its common stock to the McAlpine family interests, for $1 million, or $1.35 a share. The sale represents 10.2% of Meridians shares outstanding. The McAlpine family, which operates a number of multinational companies, including a London-based engineering and construction company, also lent to Meridian National $500,000. That amount is convertible into shares of Meridian common stock at $2 a share during its one-year term. The loan may be extended by the McAlpine group for an additional year with an increase in the conversion price to $2.50 a share. The sale of shares to the McAlpine family along with the recent sale of 750,000 shares of Meridian stock to Haden MacLellan Holding PLC of Surrey, England and a recent public offering have increased Meridians net worth to $8.5 million, said William Feniger, chief executive officer of Toledo, Ohio-based Meridian.
Ratners Group PLC, a fast-growing, acquisition-minded London-based jeweler, raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler Weisfields Inc. to $57.50 a share, or $62.1 million, from $50 a share, or $55 million, after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid Ratnerss initial offer. The other concern wasnt identified. Ratnerss chairman, Gerald Ratner, said the deal remains of substantial benefit to Ratners. In London at mid-afternoon yesterday, Ratnerss shares were up 2 pence (1.26 cents), at 260 pence ($1.64). The sweetened offer has acceptances from more than 50% of Weisfields shareholders, and it is scheduled for completion by Dec. 10. The acquisition of 87-store Weisfields raises Ratnerss U.S. presence to 450 stores. About 30% of Ratnerss profit already is derived from the U.S.
Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said potential problems with the construction of two big cruise ships from Finland have been averted. Last week, Miami-based Carnival disclosed that Waertsilae Marine Industries, the Finnish shipyard that is building Carnivals new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy. Yesterday, Carnival said a new company has been formed in Finland that will carry on Waertsilaes shipbuilding operations. Carnival said it will be an 11% shareholder in the new company. Carnival said the Fantasy, a 2,050-passenger ship that was slated to be delivered this month, will be delivered in January. A second ship is now expected to be delivered late next year or early in 1991. Carnival had expected that ship to be delivered next fall. A planned third ship still may be built in the Finnish shipyard, or may be built elsewhere, Carnival said.
Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association took an $89.9 million charge as it reported a third-quarter loss of $70.7 million, or $12.09 a share. The Van Nuys, Calif., thrift had net income of $132,000, or three cents a share, a year ago. The bulk of the pretax charge is a $62 million write-off of capitalized servicing at the mobile home financing subsidiary, which the company said had been a big drain on earnings. The company said the one-time provision would substantially eliminate all future losses at the unit. Valley Federal also added $18 million to realestate loan reserves and eliminated $9.9 million of good will. The thrift said that after these charges and assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates, the association expects to achieve near record earnings in 1990. Valley Federal is currently being examined by regulators. New loans continue to slow; they were $6.6 million in the quarter compared with $361.8 million a year ago. The thrift has assets of $3.2 billion.
First of America Bank Corp. said it completed its acquisition of Midwest Financial Group Inc. for about $250 million. First of America, which now has 45 banks and $12.5 billion in assets, announced an agreement to acquire the Peoria, Ill., bank holding company in January. Midwest Financial has $2.3 billion in assets and eight banks. The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990, when each will adopt the First of America name. Kalamazoo, Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company. First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America. But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of Americas operating results for 1989 by $3 million to $4 million, or 15 cents to 20 cents a share.
Coleco Industries Inc., a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at $65 a share in the early 1980s, filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders. Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about $430 million, would receive about $92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed. In addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named Ranger Industries Inc. After these payments, about $225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. The Avon, Conn., companys stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the companys fortunes plunged. But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit $600 million in 1985. But as the craze died, Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988. The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court.
Sony Corp. completed its tender offer for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., with Columbia shareholders tendering 99.3% of all common shares outstanding by the Tuesday deadline. Sony Columbia Acquisition Corp., formed for the Columbia deal, will formally take ownership of the movie studio later this month, a spokesman said. Sony is paying $27 a share, or $3.55 billion, cash and is assuming $1.4 billion of long-term debt. Still unresolved is Sonys effort to hire producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber to run the studio. Sonys planned acquisition of Guber/Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million is scheduled to close Monday. Guber/Peters has been locked in litigation with Warner Communications Inc. in an attempt to get out of an exclusive production contract with Warner. Both sides are in talks to settle the dispute.
Xerox Corp. has told employees in its Crum & Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about 300 people, or 25% of the staff. A spokeswoman for Crum & Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move. She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $4 million to be spread over the next three quarters. By comparison, for the first nine months, Xerox earned $492 million, or $4.55 a share, on revenue of $12.97 billion. Earnings at Xeroxs financial-services operations actually rose slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at Crum & Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments. Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters, as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments.
Komatsu Ltd., a large integrated maker of construction machinery, posted a 32% unconsolidated gain in first-half pretax profit. For the period ended Sept.30, it earned 16.68 billion yen, (US$116.7 million) up from 12.68 billion yen the year before. Sales rose 11% to 292.32 billion yen from 263.07 billion yen. Net income surged 31% to 7.63 billion yen from 5.82 billion yen. Per-share net rose to 7.84 yen from 6.53 yen. Brisk domestic demand due to increasing capital investment pushed up sales sharply in construction and industrial machinery divisions. Domestic sales of construction machinery, such as power shovels and bulldozers rose to 142.84 billion yen from 126.15 billion yen. Demand from Europe and Southeast Asia also grew, but due to increasing production at local plants, overseas sales edged down 2.8%. Komatsu predicted that for the fiscal year ending March 31 sales will climb to 600 billion yen from 566.54 billion yen; pretax profit was forecast at 35 billion yen, up from 28.53 billion yen in fiscal 1989. Net is expected to rise to 17 billion yen from 12.82 billion yen a year earlier.
ECONOMIC GROWTH APPEARS to be leveling off, latest reports suggest. Factory orders and construction outlays were largely flat in September, while purchasing agents said manufacturing shrank further in October. Still, many economists arent predicting a recession anytime soon. The Fed is coming under pressure to cut short-term interest rates due to the apparent slowing of the economy. But it isnt clear yet whether the central bank will make such a move. Campbell Soup forced out its president and chief executive, R. Gordon McGovern, the strongest indication yet that the Dorrance family plans to take charge of reshaping the troubled food company. Campbells stock rose $3.375, to $47.125, in reaction. The Chicago Merc plans an additional circuit breaker to stem sharp drops in the market. Also, Big Board Chairman Phelan said he would support SEC halts of program trading during market crises but not any revival of a collar on trading. Georgia Gulf received a new takeover bid from investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries of $50 a share, or about $1.1 billion. The offer, which follows a $55-a-share bid that was rejected in September, steps up pressure on the chemicals concern. The minimum-wage bill worked out by Congress and Bush won easy approval in the House. The compromise plan, which boosts the minimum wage for the first time since 1981, is expected to clear the Senate soon. Steinberg sought clearance to buy more than 15% of United Airs parent, saying he may seek control. Takeover experts said they doubted the financier would make a bid by himself. An airline buy-out bill was approved by the House. The measure would make it easier for the Transportation Department to block leveraged buy-outs in the industry. USX was cited by OSHA for several health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants and may face a record fine of $7.3 million. Random House Chairman Robert Bernstein said he is resigning from the publishing house he has run for 23 years. A successor wasnt named. Cray Research indicated that the survival of a spinoff company, which is developing a new supercomputer, depends heavily on its chairman and chief designer, Seymour Cray. Light trucks and vans will face the same safety requirements as automobiles under new proposals by the Transportation Department. The Treasury plans to sell $30 billion in notes and bonds next week but will delay the auction unless Congress quickly raises the debt ceiling. U.S. farmers net income rose to a record $59.9 billion last year despite one of the worst droughts ever. Two antitrust agencies may face further cutbacks because of a complicated new funding device, some Democrats in Congress are warning. Markets -- Stocks: Volume 154,240,000 shares.

Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein. The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology. Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it. Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment, bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders, Genetics Institute said. The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1, a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage. The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects, Genetics Institute said. The company added that it has filed patent applications on a large number of different BMP proteins and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received. BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers, the company said.
The Bush administrations nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a qualified rating, rather than well qualified. People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will vote on the nomination, said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter. Mr. Thomas, currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court. Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies. Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomass nomination because of serious questions about his judgment {and} respect for the law. A senior Justice Department official, however, said the administration isnt worried about the ABA rating. Were pleased the ABA rated him qualified, David Runkel, the departments chief spokesman, said in an interview. The ABA gives a qualified rating to nominees it believes would perform satisfactorily on the bench. In contrast, the lawyers association gives a well qualified rating to those regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy.
Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51% of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation. Terms werent disclosed. Metallgesellschaft, a diversified Frankfurt, West Germany-based metals group, said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants. Lentjes product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b. H. plant engineering unit, the company said. The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading, processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units, the company said. Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ($434.4 million) and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks. The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock. A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices.
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry. Because of the rulings, the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act. The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporters home market. ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wont come until next March or later. If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law, the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports, which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements. Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $405 million from Taiwan, $400 million from South Korea and $125 million from Hong Kong, according to the ITC. In another action, the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington, Del., against imports of neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, from France and West Germany. These imports totaled about $17 million last year.
Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge. Upjohn officials said they couldnt estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees, and how many, will participate in the retirement plan. But the pharmaceutical company said it anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plans implementation will more than offset short-term costs. The program, available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older, could increase an individuals retirement benefits 10% to 20%. In addition, Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay. Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the companys two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and an effective headcount-control program. But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have, because few jobs will end up being eliminated. Its a cosmetic move, said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co. According to Upjohns estimates, only 50% to 60% of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan. Upjohn further estimated that about 50% of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced. As a result, Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $38.875 apiece. An Upjohn spokesman said he had heard nothing to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation. The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors. The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy. Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs, the spokesman said.
INTER-TEL Inc. (Chandler, Ariz.) -- Jerry Chapman, managing director of WayMar Associates, was elected a director of this business telecommunications software and systems concern. He increases the board to seven.
The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyards backlog of 15 ships. The new company will attempt to limit the shipyards losses, participants said. The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company, said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marines shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marines two big shipyards, government officials said. Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marines undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. Waertsilae Marines biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for $1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week. Waertsilae Marines bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court.
Its plans to be acquired dashed, Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital. In all, the company hopes to repay $45 million in debt through the sales, which will completely discharge its secured debt, the company said. In addition, the company has replaced its president and chief executive, naming W. James Nichol, head of the companys contract health services, to succeed B. Lee Karns. Mr. Nichol said he was extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the companys operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months. Concurrent with Mr. Nichols appointment, Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine, Calif., to St. Louis, where the company maintained its contract services offices. Mr. Karns continues as chairman. Comprehensive Care had agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk, Va., but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Comprehensive Care closed at $3.75 a share, up 12.5 cents.
Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47% decline in fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market. The St. Louis company earned $45.2 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $84.9 million, or $1.24 a share, a year earlier. Sales in the latest period were $1.76 billion, a 13% increase from last years $1.55 billion. For the year ended Sept. 30, Ralston earned $422.5 million, or $6.44 a share, up 8.9% from $387.8 million, or $5.63 a share. This years results included a gain of $70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations. Sales for the full year were $6.6 billion, up 13% from $5.8 billion. Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville, N.C., the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company. The battery plant, which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products, will be closed over the next year or so, a spokesman said. Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures, which required higher advertising spending. For the year, pet food volume was flat, the company said. Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases, but also spent more on promotion. The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales, it added. Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America. Ralston shares closed yesterday at $80.50, off $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush doesnt have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto. Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents. A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure. Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure. A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case. But the two legal experts, responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a joint letter that the president lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto. The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal. The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills, not partial measures. Moreover, they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items, and there was no discussion of a line-item veto. They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War, and all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach of the president. Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power, but that it would be a reckless course of action for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval.
